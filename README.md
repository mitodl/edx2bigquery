edx2bigquery
============

edx2bigquery is a tool for importing edX SQL and log data into Google
BigQuery for research and analysis.

To get started, install the Google Cloud SDK first:

  https://cloud.google.com/sdk/

Then generate authentication tokens using "gcloud auth login". Make sure
that "bq" and "gsutil" work properly.

Before install it on Ubuntu Server 14.04:

    $ apt-get install python-dev build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev zlib1g-dev

To install:

    $ python setup.py develop
  
Also, setup the file edx2bigquery_config.py in your current working directory.  Example:

    #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # sample edx2bigquery_config.py file
    #
    course_id_list = [
            "MITx/2.03x/3T2013",
    ]
    
    courses = {
        'year2': course_id_list,
        'all_harvardx': [
            "HarvardX/AI12.1x/2013_SOND",
        ],
    }

    # google cloud project access
    auth_key_file = "USE_GCLOUD_AUTH"
    auth_service_acct = None
    
    # google bigquery config
    PROJECT_ID = "x-data"
    
    # google cloud storage
    GS_BUCKET = "gs://x-data"
    
    # local file configuration
    COURSE_SQL_BASE_DIR = "X-Year-1-data-sql"
    COURSE_SQL_DATE_DIR = '2013-09-08'
    TRACKING_LOGS_DIRECTORY = "TRACKING_LOGS"
    
    #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                          The course_id is determined by parsing each line of the tracking log.  Each line is also

                                                          as a parsed JSON dict for certain event_type values.  Also, key names cannot contain
