Make the following tables for IRT analyses:

1. course-item table, with one row per assessment item.

   Currently only includes capa problems (LTI and other xmodules / xblocks not included)

2. person-item table, with one row per item & person.  Only includes items in the course-item table.

3. course_problem

4. person_problem

5. problem_first_attempt_correct

A problem may contain one or more items.  Each item is a question which is graded for correctness 
by the edX system.  For example, an item may be a multiple choice question, or a custom response
question.  A problem may contain a multiple choice question and a custom response question,
together.
