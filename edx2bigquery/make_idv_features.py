'''
Analyze engagement of IDV enrollees (and non-IDV enrollees) before end of the course, including
forum, video, and problem activity, up to the point of IDV enrollment (or last ever IDV enrollment
in the course, for non-IDVers).  Also include context about prior activity in other courses,
if course_report_latest.person_course_viewed is available.  Produces idv_analysis table, in each course.
