    In early SQL tables from edX, enrollment records were deleted when a learner un-enrolled.
    This would then cause that learner's records to no longer appear in the SQL data
    dump to researchers.  This further caused problems because there would be learners
    who received certificates (and appeared in the certificates tables) but weren't
    in the auth_user or auth_userprofile or enrollment tables.

    One way around this was to incrementally load all the user, userprofile, etc. tables
    from every weekly dump, so that if a learner ever appeared as being registered
    in a course, the learner would stay that way.

    This workaround didn't completely solve the problem, however, for early courses,
    and thus additional data had to be manualy requested from edX.

    These issues were all resolved for courses after ~Spring 2014, when un-enrollment
    was changed such that it did not cause deletion of the enrollment record, but
    rather, just a change of the "active" flag within the enrollment record.

    Here, to workaround the problem, for a given course_id, we generate users.csv, profiles.csv, 
    enrollment.csv, certificates.csv, from collections 
    stored in mongodb, for a specified course.  These mongodb collections were curated
    and produced for the Hx and MITx Year 1 reports.
    
    Uses mongoexport.
